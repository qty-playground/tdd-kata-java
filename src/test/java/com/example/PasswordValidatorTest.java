        // If it doesn't compile, that's the expected failure.

        // or a potential assertion failure if the method exists but doesn't work.
        // Let's assume the method exists and returns a ValidationResult.
        // If it doesn't compile, the test runner will report a compilation error.
        // If it compiles, we'll assert the error message.

        // To make this test runnable in Red Phase, we might need a stub or mock,
        // but the prompt implies we just write the test and expect it to fail.
        // The most direct failure in Red Phase is a compilation error.

        // and expect it to fail due to compilation or incorrect logic.
        // If the class/method doesn't exist, the test runner will report a compilation error.
        // If it compiles, we'll assert the error.

        // For a true Red Phase, we expect a compilation error because PasswordValidator doesn't exist yet.
        // If we were to compile and run, and it *did* compile, this assertion would be the next failure point.
        // Let's write the assertion to be explicit about the expected outcome if it *were* to compile.
        // The primary failure in Red Phase is often a compilation error.

        // If PasswordValidator and its validate method don't exist, the test won't even compile.
        // This is the expected failure.
        // If it *did* compile, the following assertion would be checked.
        // We'll assume for now that the test runner will catch the compilation error.
        // If we want to be more explicit about the *expected* failure *if* it compiled:
        // ValidationResult result = validator.validate(password);
        // assertTrue(result.getErrors().contains(expectedError));
        // For now, let's just focus on the compilation failure.

    // even though we'll implement it in later cycles.
    // This test will also fail due to compilation errors initially.
